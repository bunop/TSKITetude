# SheepTreeSeq: Scalable analysis of sheep genome diversity using tree sequences

The aim of this project is to analyze the sheep genome diversity using
[tskit](https://tskit.dev/) *TreeSequence* files. In this context data from
Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and data from SNPchips will be analyzed.
